### Title: _The Richmond Election Comparator_

### Author: Eric Johnson

### Code version:

Last updated: August 26, 2024

### Description:

The basic idea is that users can use it to dive into voting information and study voting patterns at a much more local level than is often the case with visual presentations of voting stats. Often those are aggregated by county or state, but I wanted to get more local, so I pulled together stats at the level of voting precinct. And Iâ€™m concentrating on my home town, Richmond, Virginia.
